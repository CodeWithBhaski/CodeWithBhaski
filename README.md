# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I am currently working on<br>
Enterprise-level Power Platform Governance frameworks, scalable environment strategies, automated compliance monitoring, and ALM-driven deployment pipelines<br>

🌱 I am currently learning<br>
Advancing my skills in Fabric Analytics and exploring the capabilities of Copilot Studio to integrate AI-driven insights into low-code solutions.<br>

💬 Ask me about<br>
The CoE Starter Kit, Power Platform governance frameworks, automating administrative tasks with PowerShell, and how to cut manual deployment times through efficient Pipelines and DevOps strategies.<br>

⚡ Fun Fact<br>
I’ve spent the last few years acting as a "manual task's worst enemy". I live for the "Aha!" moment when a PowerShell script replaces a repetitive process—a habit that has helped me slash deployment times by 30% , boost delivery speeds by 20%.<br>
